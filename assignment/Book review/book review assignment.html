    <h2>Letter to His Father by Franz Kafka</h2><hr></center>

    <td style="text-align: justify;">This is a letter from Franz Kafka to his father, Hermann Kafka. Frankz Kafka is known as one of the most influential writers of the 20th century, with eerie books such as The Trial, The Castle, and Metamorphosis.

        In a letter directed to his father, he confesses the deep shame and alienation developed during his childhood. That is still ingrained in Franz despite maturing into adulthood. Kafka’s upbringing was troublesome, to say the least. He felt a substantial burden placed upon him by his father, a man that was always intellectually and physically stronger than him, towering over Franz as a predator gazes upon its prey. None of Franz’s choices made either in his professional career or in his romantic life seemed to impress the family’s overseer. Franz Kafka acknowledges that his father was a decent man and maybe would have even been friends with him in another life if he was not the son of immense Hermann Kafka. Kafka, the name that he never truly filled with pride and respect, almost always sick and too weak to put the vigor his father expected from someone carrying his name.
        
        I found that reading this letter was the rawest insight into the mind of one of the greatest writers, which made me realize that the stories, such as The Trial and The Castle, were written from a place of pain and alienation, where he is the protagonist of the story. He is Mr.K, a man that has been put on trial where he never comes to know the crime he is being persecuted for, nor the nature of the judicial procedures taking place. Kafka wrote about how it felt to be an inadequate tiny human in an unforgiving absurd world that gives you nothing but existential anxiety and a life full of torment. It is haunting reading the words of a dead man that did not desire great riches and luxury. He wanted nothing more from life than to be accepted by his father and live his days peacefully without the demons that came from within. Instead, he was faced with a cruel life cut short by tuberculosis.
        
        This point is illustrated in the following quote:
        
        “… it is, after all, not necessary to fly right into the middle of the sun, but it is necessary to crawl to a clean little spot on Earth where the sun sometimes shines, and one can warm oneself a little.”
        
        I will give this book a 5/5 as I believe that Franz Kafka has captured the fundamental fears and desires that we all have as humans. I think that everyone can be reminded of a point in their lives where they felt like a deficient creature in a foreign country. The fact that the topic Kafka is writing about is so unremarkably normal is what makes this letter timeless and forever relevant.
        A resounding story that results from Kafka’s childhood is narrated in the letter. Kafka recounts how on one night he begged his parents for water to quench his thirst. He begs and begs, waiting for someone to fulfill his request, and give him water, although he tells that he was not actually thirsty, but wants attention. Kafka’s whining continues. Then his father comes into his room. Kafka grows scared. His father then picks him up, takes him to the balcony, closes the door, and leaves Kafka stranded in the bitter night. The scene is brutal and unsettling. And it is only after, now, in the letter that Kafka tells his real story, that after this brutal night — though the damage was not to be done physically — the psychological damage would be done. Kafka then became afraid of his father’s remorselessness; that his father was capable of doing terrible damage, and possibly enraging himself to harm Kafka worse than he had already done, while Kafka would remain helpless.</td></table>

<h2>It Will End With Us by Colleen Hoover </h2><hr>

</center><br><br>
<table>
    <td style=";text-align: justify;">It Ends With Us is a book that has soared in the popularity stakes thanks to TikTok and Instagram. Full of emotion, heartache, pain and realisation, It Ends With Us is a considerate read from Colleen Hoover.

        A story of love, heartache, betrayal and personal decisions, It Ends With Us follows a young woman named Lily. When Lily meets Ryle, a successful surgeon, she thinks that her dreams have come true. In a life far away from her small-town upbringing, Lily knows the tides have changed in her favour. However, Lily soon discovers that Ryle isn’t the perfect man. Despite the fact that Ryle is charming and clever, he has a difficult time with relationships. This unsettles Lily and she find that her thoughts are occupied by her old love, Atlas. When Lily gets the chance to reconnect with Atlas, her new life with Ryle is under threat. What life will Lily choose?
        
        A salient personal dedication from the author soon gives the reader a clue as to what they expect to encounter when they open It Ends With Us. A book that will leave you quite raw, exposed, conflicted and teary, It Ends With Us is a hard-hitting modern romance title.
        
        I immediately warmed to lead character Lily, Hoover’s sympathetic lead. I got the feeling that Lily could easily be our friend, sister, colleague, or just someone we know. Lily’s experiences are very connective and relatable. Lily’s life is a solid representation of many women right now, in the past and in the future. For some, It Ends With Us may hit a little too close to home for some readers which is why I issue a trigger warning in regards to domestic violence and emotional abuse themes. However, I will make it clear that Colleen Hoover is extremely respectable in her approach to these vital subject areas, thanks to her own personal history. This is where I admired Hoover greatly for her ability to remain impartial despite her difficult background. I appreciated this move by the author.
        
        Ultimately, It Ends With Us is a damaged love story.  There is so much heartache to experience in this one! Hoover seems to excel in this department as this umbrella theme underpins the whole novel’s narrative direction. Hoover explores the tussle in the love stakes with the two male leads, Ryle and Atlas well. This perceptive writer also delves into Lily’s world, giving us a good insight into this woman’s emotional pain, conflicting emotions and fluctuating feelings. A novel with a vital underlying message accompanying themes of power, choice, depth, personal strength and emotional sway, It Ends With Us is a universal feel novel that will easily find a way into your heart. 
        
        It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover was published on 1st May 2017 by Simon & Schuster. Details on how to purchase the book can be found here.

    <h2>The Judgment by Franz Kafka</h2><hr>

        <td style=";text-align: justify;">Those who are familiar with the work and the eccentric genius that is Czechoslovakia's very own Franz Kafka knows about his struggles throughout his life. Somebody who struggled mentally and emotionally throughout his life, his relationship with his father was one that created an insecurity with which Kafka would live with and this was reflected within his writing. He had three sisters and both a mother and father that would outlive him (he died in 1924, his parents died in the 1930s, while his sisters died during the Holocaust), but most notably a father that would degrade his son for not meeting his expectations as being masculine enough according to his tastes. Simply put: Franz Kafka's father felt as if Franz failed him. This emotion is explored in the work that I feel does the most powerful job in describing the relationship between Kafka and his father. While "The Metamorphosis" presents a father that is hot-tempered and is perhaps the most notable work within Kafka's life, it is "The Judgment" that puts a concentration on a father that sees his son as being hopeless. The story leaves plenty of questions lingering in the head regarding the question of, "what just happened?" but one can affirm in fact that, yes, this DID just happen.

            Georg Bendemann works for his father as a merchant and is spending his time writing letters to an unnamed friend of his who lives in Russia. This friend was struggling at home and made the decision to move where he was struggling even more. Some of these struggles went to the point of being physical, such as jaundice. This friend of his made the decision to remain isolated to the point that his comments were emotionless and indifferent, almost as if the distance made his heart grow colder instead of fonder to the situation. This coldness was demonstrated at the death of Georg's mother. During this time, Georg got engaged to a Frieda Brandenfeld, who objected to such a friend from attending, but the communication between Georg and the unnamed friend continues.
            
            Why have the friend go unnamed? Perhaps this would have to do with building his reputation. To have this friend nameless creates a mysterious emotional cloud to which adds to the enigma of what is his personality. If he was given a name, one may start to build an impression, make judgments, and this would turn into an opportunity to learn much more about this individual. More than likely, Kafka only wants us to know so much about this friend. This "only knowing so much" affair was common for this author, a prime example being a complexity behind the appearance of Gregor Samsa in insect-form in "The Metamorphosis." This same approach is used to provide the reader with scarce details involving Georg's friend. We know enough about him, but not too much.
            
            The key character and the one Kafka probably wants us to pay the most attention to is Georg's surviving father, who lost his wife in what he felt was a larger loss for him. He initially became less aggressive, but this would only be an emotion that was bottled up. He remains within the darkness of his area, which reflects his emotions to the situation. Not only has he lost his wife, but he feels that the relationship with his son is almost nonexistent. He is beginning to lose the ability to take care of himself which leads to childlike tendencies, such as dirty underwear. His son often ignores his basic needs and will only tend to him when necessary, which leads to anger on his father's behalf. With regard to his relations with the friend, he first believes he does not exist. Then, after Georg reminds him, exclaims that he DOES know this friend and that he has betrayed everyone, his friend, his mother's will, and his father's health and well-being, in order to fulfill his sexual desire and go forth with engagement with Frieda. His father adds how this friend turns away from everything he says, but is happy to listen to him, and that he's so obsessive that he is not taking specific priorities into account. Georg's father sentences him to drown, which leads him to be forced away from the house and out to a bridge where he finds himself drowning to death in the water. The ending describes the flow of traffic moving forth and paints a picture of life going by just as it has, ignoring another loss.
